Main API
========

The experiment api is based on several submodules which wrap themselves the
:doc:`cppwrapper`. The api is mainly use for creating experimental tasks.
A library of several differnt tasks has already been created in the :doc:`_tasks`
sumodules.


Example
-------

The following example would create a task that presents a cross for
five seconds on monitor 2::

    import experiment.api as xp
    Cue = xp.Cue(xp.SOUND['peep'], xp.STATIC['cross'], 5)
    xp.Screen.open()
    Cue.present()
    xp.Screen.close()
