There are five primary steps which have to be followed:

1)	Look for the website of the toolbox you want to know more about. In the scope of this example, it will be numpy. (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/)
2)	Select the right version of the toolkit you are using. It may seem negligible, but looking at the wrong version of the toolkit
	can be quit severe. An example is that the default parameter of a function may have changed and therefore the code relying on the changed function
	will produce incorrect results.
3)	Identify the function of interest
4)	What "goes in"? After identifying the function of interest, the order and TYPE of the input parameters are of major importance.
5) 	What "comes out"? is the final question. Does the data format match the programmers expectation, does it need to be transformed, is all necessary information
	included in the output?
